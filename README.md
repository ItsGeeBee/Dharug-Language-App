## My Task

- Create a space Indigenous Australians can connect by sharing and teaching clan-specific language 
between loved ones and a desire to educate and inspire change, we were motivated to create this project with an aspiration to do our part to help raise awareness of the ongoing impacts of colonisation 


## User Story

```md
AS an Indigenous Australian 

I WANT to be able to learn and teach other people from my clan about our language 

SO that I can feel a greater sense of belonging and community 
```
